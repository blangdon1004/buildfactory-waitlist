              <p>
                The Platform is an intelligence-enabled platform that allows users to upload 2D diagrams and 3D models and converts them to fabrication quotes for purchase. Along with these quotes, the Platform contains certain features; for example, the Platform may generate data, including benchmarking, materials takeoffs, and costs analyses in relation to the converted models, or provide interoperability options for project management. These features form an integral part of the Platform.
              </p>

              <p>
                To use the Platform, you will have the opportunity to choose one of the subscription plans offered by BuildFactory ("Subscription Plan"). Your use of and access to the Platform may be subject to your completion of the process of purchase of the Subscription Plan and payment of applicable fees. BuildFactory reserves the right to offer its users free trials and evaluation products. These Terms would continue to apply to the use of such free trials or evaluation products.

                <p>
                  (c) Reporting: You agree to report any unscheduled system downtime and any error, bug, or defect in the Platform to the details set forth in BuildFactory's contact page available at https://BuildFactory.io/contact/ immediately upon becoming aware or receiving notice of such system downtime, error, bug, or defect.

                BuildFactory reserves the right at any time to add, modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Platform (or any part thereof) with or without notice or cause.

                BuildFactory reserves the right to provide minor modifications or enhancements, or program temporary fixes or patches, if any, to the Platform ("Updates"). You agree that the addition of major functions or significant new features to the Platform is not an Update. BuildFactory shall, in its sole discretion, have the right to determine what constitutes an Update.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>
              <p>
                You acknowledge that the Platform contains BuildFactory's and its licensors' trade secrets and confidential information. You agree to hold and maintain the Platform in confidence, and not to furnish any other person with a copy of the Platform. You agree to use a reasonable degree of care to protect the confidentiality of the Platform. You will not remove or alter any of BuildFactory's or its licensors' proprietary notices. Your obligations under this Clause continue even after these Terms have expired or been terminated. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you further agree not to publish or otherwise publicly distribute the results of any benchmark tests related to the Platform that are made available to you by BuildFactory, its affiliates, and their licensors.

                <p>
                  (a) Modification – BuildFactory reserves the right at any time to modify these Terms and to add new or additional terms or conditions on your use of the Platform. Such modifications and additional terms and conditions will be communicated to you and, unless expressly rejected (in which these Terms shall terminate), will be effective immediately and will be incorporated into these Terms. In the event, you refuse to accept such changes, these Terms and license will terminate.

                <p>
                  (b) Severability - If any provision of these Terms is determined by any court or other competent authority to be unlawful or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will continue in effect. If any unlawful or unenforceable provision would be lawful or enforceable if part of it were deleted, that part will be deemed to be deleted, and the rest of the provision will continue in effect (unless that would contradict the clear intention of the clause, in which case the entirety of the relevant provision will be deemed to be deleted).
                </p>

                <p>
                  (c) Assignment - You shall not distribute, license, sell, transfer or assign your rights or obligations hereunder to others in any manner without BuildFactory's prior written consent.
