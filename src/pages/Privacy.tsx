              This Privacy Policy ("Policy") outlines Build Factory, Inc's ("BuildFactory", "we" or "us") practices in relation to the storage, use, processing, and disclosure of personal data that you have chosen to share with us when you access our website https://buildfactory.io/ and the marketplace and software applications that we make available (collectively the "Platform"), or personal data that we may have access to in relation to your use of the Platform.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6">
              BuildFactory is the "data controller" in relation to such processing of personal data. We have appointed representatives in the European Union ("EU") and United Kingdom ("UK"), the details of which can be found under "Contact Us" below.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">THE DATA WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              For the purposes of this Policy, personal data means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed – for example, anonymous data.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6">
              We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you to provide you with or in connection with the Platform. Such personal data includes:

            <p className="mb-6">
              We do not intend to collect or process any special categories of personal data or data that is deemed particularly sensitive (such as information relation to race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, or health data). However, to the extent you proactively provide us with such information (e.g., where such information is provided unsolicited in communications) then we will process such personal data on the basis that you have provided your express consent by sharing it with us.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6">
              We also collect, use, and share aggregated data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose.

            <p className="mb-6">
              Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of the arrangement we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform our obligations under the arrangement we have with you or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with features of the Platform). In this case, we may have to cancel or limit your access to the Platform, but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6">
              We may also collect personal data about individuals who apply for roles with BuildFactory. We may collect personal data such as identity and contact details, along with information about relevant qualifications and experience for the purpose of taking steps, at your request, prior to entering into a contract with you (such as a contract of employment). This may involve the processing of some special category information (such as health related information where we may need to make reasonable adjustments, which we will process where it is necessary in connection with specific rights and obligations under employment law). ‍
